          </h3>
          <p class="card-text mb-auto">Purpose:
The current employment limitations policy does not adequately serve the best interests of the department and as such I do not believe that agents have adequately devoted their full while being in both HLS & FPS at the same time.

(1). General:
Under the direction of the Secretary of Homeland Security, the following is to be followed:
In accordance with an EO from President Geithner, you may only be in 2 EB agencies—as such— both of these may be within the Department of Homeland Security
You may be in HLS & SS and FPS & SS at the same time
You may no longer be in FPS & HLS at the same time
You will have the ability to transfer between components at the approval of the Secretary
(2). Authority:
Any Agent found to be in breach of this policy shall be forced to choose between one or the other
Any agent employed in both FPS & HLS by June 4th, 2018 11:59PM PST are to be considered exempt from this policy, however once they lose their position in either they can not be in both again.

expected to exhibit professionalism and to be considerate of their
peers. Part of this, while we will have fun in there, also applies to
the communications channels.
(1). General:

          </h3>
          <p class="card-text mb-auto">Purpose:
This policy is meant to designate employment activity for each component of the Department of Homeland Security:

(1). General
In Homeland Security, agents are to be active within events and patrolling on their own. This means that they must attend events and patrol as well. Every employee within Homeland Security are under supervision requiring their activity. The Secretary and Deputy Secretary will always be monitoring who is active and who is attending events.
Agents that do not attend any events or patrol at all will be subjected to be terminated for inactivity. This means they cannot just attend a few events only. They should be attending events consistently as they are scheduled.
Every event is logged with a screenshot of all attendees, including the date that the event was hosted/scheduled. If any agent does not dedicate their time to the Department at all, they may be terminated for inactivity. They are not allowed to sue the Department or anyone at all. They may re-tryout or submit a Common Application.



(2). Authority
Under the direction of the Secretary of Homeland Security, the following is ordered:
This policy is in to be put into effect immediately.
